Wiremock for Consumer Driven Contracts

# Introduction

We would like to use the Wiremock's JSON stub definitions as a point of entry to our approach of Consumer Driven Contracts.

# Notations

  * __Collaborator__ - a service whom your service can contact
  * __Client test__ - since your service is a client of your collaborator then the tests of your service are __client tests__
  * __Server test__ - from a your service's (client) perspective your collaborator is a server that provides a functionality
  thus tests of your collaborators are __server tests__

# Why?

The main purpose of this approach is to:

  - ensure that our stubs are doing exactly what the actual implementation does
  - generate acceptance test cases from stub definitions (ATDD)
  - make the stub definitions reusable

Below we depict the idea behind client and server side testing. Let's assume that for the sake
of this description that there is a _service X_ calling a _service Y_.

## Client side (service X)

During the tests you want to have a Wiremock instance up and running that simulates the service Y.
You would like to feed that instance with a proper stub definition. That stub definition would need
to be valid from the Wiremock's perspective but should also be reusable on the server side.

__Summing it up:__ On this side, in the stub definition, you can use patterns for request stubbing and you need exact
values for responses.

## Server side (service Y)

Being a service Y since you are developing your stub, you need to be sure that it's actually resembling your
concrete implementation. You can't have a situation where your stub acts in one way and your application on
production behaves in a different way.

That's why from the provided stub acceptance tests will be generated that will ensure
that your application behaves in the same way as you define in your stub.

__Summing it up:__ On this side, in the stub definition, you need exact values as request and can use patterns/methods
for response verification.

# Description

To achieve that we needed to tweak the standard Wiremock stub definitions by providing a possibility of entering
two values for one field. This is done via the following pattern:

```
${VALUE_FOR_CLIENT_TESTS}:${VALUE_FOR_SERVER_TESTS}
```

That means that depending on the need you can take either value for the client test or server test.

## Example

Let's take a look at the following example

```
{
    "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "urlPattern": "${/[0-9]{2}}:${/12}"
    },
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "body": "${{\"date\":\"2015-01-14\"}}:${isCurrentDate(it.date)}",
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "text/plain"
        }
    }
}
```

### Client side

From the client's perspective, in this particular scenario, you want a regexp matching a URL on which you send
a request (`[/0-9]{2}`) and a concrete value returned (`2015-01-14`). That way we will change your stub definition to:

```
{
    "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "urlPattern": "/[0-9]{2}"
    },
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "body": {
            "date" : "2015-01-14"
        },
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "text/plain"
        }
    }
}
```

### Server side

On the server side we need to generate acceptance tests. So we need to check that for given input (request)
we receive some matching output (response).

In this case we want to send a request to an endpoint `/12` and check if in the body of the response
we will receive the current date (`isCurrentDate(it.date)`).

The latter value will be checked if it's a method (if it contains parentheses) and then a method will be
called with the corresponding field's (status, body, headers etc.) value as input.


```
class AcceptanceSpec extends AssurestSpec {

    // TODO: Define how it's going to look like

}
